          Here's a time line of Marie Curie life:
        </p>
        <ul id="tribute-info">
          <li><span class="bold">1867: Maria Salomea Skodowska, later became known as Marie Curie, is born in Warsaw, Poland, during the Congress Kingdom of Poland, Russian Empire.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1883 - 1885: Skodowska receives a gold medal for being the highest student in her class after completing her secondary school. Because her father's money were squandered due to poor investment, she was forced to work, first as a teacher and then as a governess. Her wages enable her to fund her sister Bronislawa's medical studies in Paris, France, with the understanding that Bronislawa will eventually assist her in obtaining an education.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1891 - 1894: In 1891, Skodowska comes to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. She starts using the name Marie. She studies late into the night and earns degrees in physics and mathematics. She meets Pierre Curie, who is finishing his PhD in science, in the spring of 1894. </span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1895: On July 25, Marie and Pierre will marry. She adopts her husband's last name. Their marriage signals the beginning of a collaboration that will soon have world-changing outcomes.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1896 - 1898: In 1896, a French scientist called Henri Becquerel discovers that the metal uranium emits peculiar energy beams. He reports his findings to Marie, who begins researching the phenomena she ultimately labels radioactivity. The Curies announce the discovery of two new elements, radium and polonium, in 1898. Polonium is named after Marie's home country of Poland.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1903: Marie receives her doctorate of science in June, making her the first woman in France to do so. Marie and Pierre were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in November, together with Becquerel, for their contributions to the discovery and study of radioactivity. Marie is the first female recipient of the award. (The French Academy of Sciences had not recognised Marie's efforts and had deleted her name in its proposal to the Nobel committee, but it was later put forward after Pierre requested that they be considered for the prize together.)</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1906: On April 19, Pierre is killed in a car accident. In May, Marie will take over as his Sorbonne lecturer. She is the school's first female teacher. She focuses all of her attention to finishing the scientific study that she and Pierre began.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1910: Marie’s fundamental treatise on radioactivity is published.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1911: Marie is awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the isolation of pure radium.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1914 - 1918: In 1914, World War I begins. Throughout the war, Marie works alongside her daughter Irène to make X-ray technology available for use in the medical treatment of injured soldiers.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1922: Marie's research will now be focused on the chemistry of radioactive compounds and their medicinal applications.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1932: Marie assists in the establishment of the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Bronislawa, her sister, has been appointed director of the institute.</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold">1934: Marie passes away near Sallanches, France. Her death was caused by leukemia caused by radiation exposure.</span></li>
