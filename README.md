2. Navigate to your local computer to save this project.
3. Open the corresponding folder using your favorite code editor.
4. Click index.html and enjoy!
## Technologies Used

Every project were developed only with HTML and CSS. No framework is utilized in this course because it is intended for people who are completely new to web design (like me then) or who are just starting out and want to learn more.
## Projects Description

**1. Survey Form**

Survey Form is the first project that I worked on, among several others. This project aims to gather user opinions regarding their experiences with the freeCodeCamp website. Several forms such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns, were used in this project.

**2. Tribute Page**

Tribute Page is the second project I developed following the Survey Form. This project tells us about honoring a person, which in my case was Marie Curie, who extremely adored science until her death. This project shows the ability to structure content using HTML tags and style it using CSS.

**3. Technical Documentation Page**

The technical documentation page is a unique project, in my opinion. Because this project is using less CSS but too much HTML. I even remembered how many hours I spent back and forth on countless websites to find the right articles. The use of navbars, articles, code blocks, and other features is highlighted in this project.

**4. Product Landing Page**

This is the project I loved the most. Product landing page is used to promote a product or service; in my case, I chose the product. This project was focused on how we improved CSS because pretty and responsive interfaces are what customers love. This project also showcases responsive layouts, HTML forms, and much more.

**5. Personal Portfolio Website**

Finally, this is the final project that I submitted for the course. In this project, we are free to determine the design of our website. This project combines various techniques from the first material until the last to make it attractive, responsive, and functional.
